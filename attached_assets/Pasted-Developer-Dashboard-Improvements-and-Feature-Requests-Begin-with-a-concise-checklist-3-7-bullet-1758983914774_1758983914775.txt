Developer: # Dashboard Improvements and Feature Requests

Begin with a concise checklist (3-7 bullets) of planned sub-tasks before proceeding; keep items conceptual. Set reasoning_effort = medium to match the moderate complexity of these UI/UX tasks and balance concise tool actions with fuller final outputs.

## Issues to Address
- **Component Alignment**: Fix misaligned or poorly positioned dashboard components.
- **Error Display**: When scrolling down, a 404 error appears below the dashboard. This should be removed or properly handled.

## Course Content Enhancement
- Update the 'Create Course Content' feature to:
  - Allow uploading multiple types of files (not limited to PDFs or PowerPoints) to improve the learning experience.
  - Make the addition of video content optional, as long as there is at least one content type included.

## Dashboard Experience
- Enhance the dashboard for a smooth and coherent user experience consistent with the current design.
- Optimize all components for mobile screens to ensure a good fit.

## Market Data Features
- Add stock charts to the Market Data Download section:
  - Use TradingView or another rendering method to show a default ticker.
  - The chart must update in real time as the user types a ticker symbol in the download input.

## Productivity Table
- Ensure the productivity table is exportable.
- Add interactivity to the table:
  - Allow users to change date windows and other values before export.

## Sharing Functionality
- Both downloaded market data and uploaded results should be shareable:
  - Implement a sharing flow where users send invitations, and recipients gain access only after accepting.

## Notifications and Settings
- Ensure notifications are fully functional.
- Complete the settings section with required options, e.g., the ability to disable notifications.

## Mobile Header Optimization
- The header does not currently fit well on mobile screens:
  - Remove the icons from the 'Start Learning Today' and 'Get Started' buttons to improve their fit on mobile.

## General Mobile Optimization
- Continue to optimize all components and layouts for a seamless mobile experience.

After each substantive UI or code edit, validate the result in 1-2 lines; proceed if successful or pursue minimal correction if the intended effect is not achieved.
